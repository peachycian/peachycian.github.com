The street has two lanes of motor traffic, both travelling toward the viewer, and is lined with bare deciduous trees. The footpaths appear wide, although there is much street clutter, and parking and loading bays take chunks from the pavement. A van turns to the viewer's left, while a number 79 Dublin Bus destined for the City Centre turns right along with two cars behind it. The street is lined almost entirely with historic four-storied red-brick buildings, mostly in use as restaurants and bars." /></a><br />

<br /></p>

<h3 id="the-trial-so-far">The Trial So Far</h3>
<p>In response to the pandemic, Dublin City Council asked the public for places where they would like more space given to active transport - walking, cycling, using mobility aids, scooting, and new transit like e-scooters. The single most requested change, <a href="https://dublininquirer.com/2021/05/05/here-are-the-transport-changes-2-300-people-asked-for-to-make-the-city-better-for-covid-travel">with 10% of the overall submissions</a>, was to make Capel Street car-free. However, the Council’s first proposal was underwhelming - motor traffic remained on the streets, with footpaths widened in only a limited number of places.</p>

<p><a href="https://janethorner.ie/post/improved-plans-for-partial-pedestrianisation-of-capel-street/">A public consultation on the plan received over 4,500 responses</a>, and showed support from a majority of the public, residents, and business owners, with 85% of the public voicing support, and many requesting pedestrianisation. A new proposal was created, which included a car-free trial for 6 weeks in the summer - but only after 6:30pm on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. Given the <a href="https://twitter.com/NickyRyan_/status/1404107932057444356?s=20">huge success of this trial</a>, the car-free nights were extended for a further six weeks, after which a public consultation on the scheme was to be held in September.</p>

<p>However, when <a href="https://twitter.com/DubCityCouncil/status/1429839251542261765?s=20">the announcement of the end of the trial</a> towards the end of August resulted in many complaints, the trial was yet again extended to the end of September, continuing during the consultation. This is where we currenly stand.
<br /><br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="so-whats-the-plan-now">So, What’s the Plan Now?</h3>
<p>There are four general options in the consultation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Return to what we had before, with no pedestrianisation.</li>
  <li>Return to what we had before, including removing widened footpaths.</li>
  <li>Make the trial arrangement permanent, with pedestrianisation after 6:30pm on weekend nights.</li>
  <li>Make the streets pedestrianised 24/7 (with deliveries at set times).</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I strongly support the third choice. This would allow a redesign of the streetscapes of Capel and Parliament Streets, without having to design around cars. We could plant trees and other greenery, which would help with <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.603757/full?utm_source=S-TWT&amp;utm_medium=SNET&amp;utm_campaign=ECO_FEVO_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit">pollution, sound dampening, and rainwater absorption.</a> We could properly set out spaces for people passing though and those dining and drinking, allowing for easier social distancing and easier movement. The clutter of traffic lights and signs can be removed, high kerbs changed to a level and smooth street surface, and street furniture like public benches installed, all of which would make the streets more <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09687599727010?casa_token=XXktafDRMDcAAAAA%3AR9DA2CPVJ-Im3Tw7FjkhiFsFdIfxblslXCevBePpi0XYQwJRwvogWBEEHR_lxGRBRUfUguxukd7Tng&amp;">accessible to the disabled.</a> Finally, with no cars, noise and air pollution will be reduced, and the street will be much safer for all, and dining outdoors will just be far more pleasant.</p>

<p>What about the effects on congestion - where will all the displaced motor traffic go? Surprisingly, it just stops existing! People will make trips at different times, or choose to take public or active transport instead, keeping traffic at the same balancing point as before. This phenomenon is often referred to as traffic evaporation, and is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand#Reduced_demand">extension of induced demand</a>, a well documented effect. This is why building more roads doesn’t seem to help traffic: it encourages more and more people to drive until that tipping point is reached.</p>

<p>People often point to Irish weather, and speculate if people will be willing to dine outdoors year-round. However, continental cities like Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Brussels, and even Paris have plenty of pedestrianised streets and outdoor dining, and have roughly equivalent levels of rainfall in Winter. In fact, on average Paris actually has a greater number of rainy days than Ireland between October and June!

To the left, an old wrought iron lamppost, planter boxes and screens separate diners from traffic that's just out of view. To the right, several people walk long the old footpath, and several shops are seen, shutters down. The centre of the picture shows tables with potted plants, hand sanitiser, and soy sauce, all with umbrellas up. Most tables appear to be full." /></a><br />

<h3 id="how-to-participate">How to participate</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://consultation.dublincity.ie/traffic-and-transport/feedback-on-traffic-free-trial-at-capel-street-par/">consultation page is here</a>.</strong> Below a summary of the project there is a link to complete an “online survey” - click this to start the consultation.</p>

<p>It can be completed in <strong>under 2 minutes</strong> - to show support you need to click 7 buttons total. <strong>There is only one mandatory question.</strong> I’ve listed the questions I <em>recommend</em> you give your answer to below in bold. If you would like to support both streets being car-free 24/7, I’ve also made notes of which options support this. However, I’d recommend giving your opinion to as many questions as you’re able. I’ll give some inspiration below the list of questions, and you shouldn’t be shy about copy-pasting your own answers from one section into another if it applies to both.</p>

<p>Most importantly, <strong>you should be giving your own opinions here.</strong> This post is a guide on <em>how to have your say</em>, not on <em>what to say.</em> This is an opportunity for you to let the Council know what you think - just be honest!<br />
