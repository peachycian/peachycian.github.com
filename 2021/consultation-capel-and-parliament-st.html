<p><a href="/assets/consultation-capel-and-parliament-st/Parliament-Street-2017.jpg"><img src="/assets/consultation-capel-and-parliament-st/Parliament-Street-2017.jpg" alt="A photograph of Parliament Street on a clear Autumnal day, taken facing southwards from Dublin City Hall. The street has two lanes of motor traffic, both travelling toward the viewer, and is lined with bare deciduous trees. The footpaths appear wide, although there is much street clutter, and parking and loading bays take chunks from the pavement. A van turns to the viewer's left, while a number 79 Dublin Bus destined for the City Centre turns right along with two cars behind it. The street is lined almost entirely with historic four-storied red-brick buildings, mostly in use as restaurants and bars." /></a><br />

<br /></p>

<h3 id="the-trial-so-far">The Trial So Far</h3>
<p><em>Note: “car-free”, “no motor traffic”, etc. will be used instead of “pedestrianised” to indicate retained access to the street for bicycles, e-scooters, etc.</em></p>

<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing capacity on public transport, Dublin City Council asked the public in May 2020 to suggest where in the city they should give more space to active transport - walking, cycling, using mobility aids, scooting, and new transit like e-scooters. The most requested location, with 10% of the overall submissions, was Capel Street.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> However, DCC’s first proposal for the street was underwhelming to many - motor traffic remained on the majority of the street, with footpaths widened in only a limited number of places.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>A public consultation on the plan received over 4,500 responses, with over 85% of the public in favour of giving more space to active transport on Capel Street, and many requesting removal of motor vehicles entirely. In response, DCC ran a trial for 6 weeks of summer 2021 where motor traffic would be banned on Capel Street and Parliament Street after 6:30pm on weekends.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> This trial was deemed a success, and was extended a further six weeks, with a public consultation held afterwards in September.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> However, the announcement by Dublin City Council of the end of the trial resulted in many complaints,<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and in response the trial was yet again extended. It is now set to run until the end of September, continuing during the consultation. This brings us to date, with the consultation having opened on the 30th of August, and due to close the 20th of September 2021.
<br /><br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h3>
<p>There are four options in the consultation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Return to what we had before, including removing the widened footpaths.</li>
  <li>Keep the widened footpaths, but end the streets being car-free.</li>
  <li>Keep the widened footpaths, and keep the streets car-free after 6:30pm on weekend nights.</li>
  <li>Make the streets car-free 24/7.</li>
</ol>

<p>I personally support option 4, making the streets car-free 24/7, and will explain why. Without motor vehicles, noise and air pollution will be reduced, the street will be much safer, and dining outdoors will be far more pleasant. It would also allow the design of Capel Street and Parliament Street to be completely overhauled - more plants and trees would help with air and noise pollution, and with rainwater absorption.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> Designing the space to accommodate outdoor dining would allow for easier movement through the streets and give more space to everyone. Removing traffic lights &amp; signs, levelling the street surface, and installing public benches would make the streets more accessible to the disabled.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>A common objection to both car-free streets and outdoor dining is the Irish weather. However, continental cities like Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Brussels, and even Paris have plenty of car-free streets and outdoor dining, with nearly equivalent levels of rainfall in Winter. On average, Paris actually has a greater number of rainy days than Ireland between October and June.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/consultation-capel-and-parliament-st/Dining-Outdoors-on-Capel-Street.jpg"><img src="/assets/consultation-capel-and-parliament-st/Dining-Outdoors-on-Capel-Street.jpg" alt="A photograph looking down along rows of tables on Capel Street on a sunny day. To the left, an old wrought iron lamppost, planter boxes and screens separate diners from traffic that's just out of view. To the right, several people walk long the old footpath, and several shops are seen, shutters down. The centre of the picture shows tables with potted plants, hand sanitiser, and soy sauce, all with umbrellas up. Most tables appear to be full." /></a><br />
<em>Outdoor dining on the widened footpaths of Capel Street, still popular despite traffic passing close by. Image: Before the Surge [Dining Outdoors on Capel Street] by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infomatique/51318715684/">William Murphy</a>, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Flickr</em>  <br />
<br />
Finally, people also worry that making these streets car-free will make congestion in the surrounding area worse. However, similar plans often reduce traffic overall - people change their travel times or take public transport instead, keeping traffic at the same balancing point as before. This phenomenon is often referred to as traffic evaporation.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> This is also why building more roads doesn’t seem to help traffic: it encourages more and more people to drive until that same balancing point is reached.<br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="how-to-participate">How to participate</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://consultation.dublincity.ie/traffic-and-transport/feedback-on-traffic-free-trial-at-capel-street-par/">consultation page is here</a>.</strong> Below a summary of the project there is a link to complete an “online survey” - click this to start the consultation.</p>

<p>It can be completed in <strong>under 2 minutes</strong> - to show support you need to click 7 buttons total. <strong>There is only one mandatory question.</strong> I’ve listed the questions I <em>recommend</em> you give your answer to below in bold. If you would like to support both streets being car-free 24/7, I’ve also made notes of which options support this. However, I’d recommend giving your opinion to as many questions as you’re able. I’ll give some inspiration below the list of questions, and you shouldn’t be shy about copy-pasting your own answers from one section into another if it applies to both.</p>

<p>Most importantly, <strong>you should be giving your own opinions here.</strong> This post is a guide on <em>how to have your say</em>, not on <em>what to say.</em> This is an opportunity for you to let the Council know what you think - just be honest!<br />
