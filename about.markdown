Hi, my name is Cian, and welcome to my (currently very bare-bones) site! This will be the home for all of my projects and ideas going forward. I'm a 23 year old Irish guy living in Dundalk, Louth who has a special interest in urban design and transportation, though I enjoy all kinds of design and creative projects. I hold an undergraduate degree in Mathematics, and am starting a Masters in Urban and Regional Planning in UCD this coming September.

### Current Projects:
These will be linked to, once I have pages for them.
* A response to the DART+ Southwest public consultation - *coming soon!*
* A new pride flag for gay men, to allow for an alternative to the umbrella rainbow flag
* A modern bus system for Dundalk, Co. Louth
* A potential future urban and commuter rail system for the Greater Dublin Area
* A future plan for intercity rail on the island of Ireland
* A re-imagining of Dungeons and Dragons to allow for easier play and more appropriate probability distributions
* A redesign of the system of street signs in Ireland to improve legibility, consistency, and safety
